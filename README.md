# Simple Python Chatbot

## Overview

This repository contains a simple Python chatbot that engages in basic conversations, providing predefined responses based on recognized keywords in user input.

## Files

- `main.py`: The main script containing the chatbot logic, user input processing, and response generation.
- `long_responses.py`: Module with longer predefined responses and an "unknown" response function.

## Usage

1. Run the `main.py` script using a Python interpreter.
   ```bash
   python main.py
## Features

- **Predefined Responses:** The chatbot recognizes specific keywords and responds with predefined messages.
- **Longer Responses:** For certain queries, the chatbot provides longer responses from the `long_responses.py` module.
- **Unknown Response:** When the chatbot is uncertain about the user input, it generates a random "unknown" response.

## Customization

- To modify the recognized keywords and responses, edit the relevant sections in `main.py`.
- Longer responses can be customized or extended in the `long_responses.py` module.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
